                        <p>
                        	New Delhi, June 3: Selection snubs despite good performances have left him feeling hurt but veteran Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh says being ignored repeatedly has not dampened his spirits and he would continue to try for a comeback in the national team.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Harbhajan finished this edition of IPL with 14 wickets from 14 games with an impressive economy rate of 6.47 (only third to Sunil Narine and Akshar Patel).

                        <p>
                        	More importantly while other spinners barring Narine and Patel found it difficult to contain top-order batsmen, most of his victims included destructive players like Glen Maxwell and Chris Gayle to name a few.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	"I do feel ignored and it's surely not a good feeling. Yes, it hurts when you are not selected for India. My performance in this year's IPL is for everyone to see. I can do what's there in my control. But let me assure you, I might get hurt by the snub but it would not stall my comeback bid. Among the Indian spinners, I believe that I bowled the best," the 33-year-old told PTI during an interaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	It is quite ironic that while other players are being rewarded for their performance in domestic cricket, Harbhajan, after close to 700 international wickets and back-to-back successful IPLs and Champions League, is getting a raw deal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	Did he have any discussions with the selection committee to find out whether they have any specific plans for him, India's second highest wicket-taker retorted, "What do you mean by specific plans for me? My job is to bowl and win matches for my team. I am doing that to the best of my abilities. Beyond that I don't need to think about anything. I still have age on my side. And I certainly believe that I will play for India".
